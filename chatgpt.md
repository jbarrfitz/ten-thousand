## Question 1:

Can you please help me write this Python static method?
```python
@staticmethod
def roll_dice(n):
        """
        Roll n number of dice
        :param n: number of dice to be rolled
        :return: tuple containing the six results
        """
        @staticmethod
    def roll_dice(n):
        """
        Roll n number of dice
        :param n: number of dice to be rolled
        :return: tuple containing the six results
        """
```

### Code produced:
```python
import random

class Dice:
    @staticmethod
    def roll_dice(n):
        """
        Roll n number of dice
        :param n: number of dice to be rolled
        :return: tuple containing the six results
        """
        # Initialize a list to store the results
        results = []
        # Roll the dice 'n' times
        for i in range(n):
            # Generate a random number between 1 and 6 (inclusive) to simulate rolling a six-sided die
            result = random.randint(1, 6)
            # Append the result to the list of results
            results.append(result)
        # Convert the list to a tuple and return it
        return tuple(results)

```

## Question 2

Can you rewrite this static method using tuple comprehension?
```python
import random

class Dice:
    @staticmethod
    def roll_dice(n):
        """
        Roll n number of dice
        :param n: number of dice to be rolled
        :return: tuple containing the six results
        """
        # Initialize a list to store the results
        results = []
        # Roll the dice 'n' times
        for i in range(n):
            # Generate a random number between 1 and 6 (inclusive) to simulate rolling a six-sided die
            result = random.randint(1, 6)
            # Append the result to the list of results
            results.append(result)
        # Convert the list to a tuple and return it
        return tuple(results)
```

### Code returned

```python
import random

class Dice:
    @staticmethod
    def roll_dice(n):
        """
        Roll n number of dice
        :param n: number of dice to be rolled
        :return: tuple containing the six results
        """
        # Use tuple comprehension to generate a tuple of n random numbers between 1 and 6 (inclusive)
        results = tuple(random.randint(1, 6) for i in range(n))
        return results
